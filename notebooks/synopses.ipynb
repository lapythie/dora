Her father Kota runs a small factory in Higashi Osaka, a district that is known for its craftsmen. Mai is shy and withdrawn. But when she visits her grandmother Shoko who lives on Nagasaki’s Goto Islands which has a rich natural environment, she is entranced by the Baramon kites that catch the wind and soar high in the sky. Wanting to fly high in the sky like these kites, Mai’s longing swells into a dream to become a pilot. Even though she works hard, the path to getting there is tougher than she had imagined. As Mai deepens her ties with the people living in her two hometowns of Higashi Osaka and Goto, her dream eventually takes a new form. She gathers enthusiastic friends to build a small electric plane that can fly to and from the islands. Her dream becomes a wing that carries everyone’s dreams and takes off.\\n\\n(Source: jdrama.wordpress)'}"

Then one evening, Midori notices something protruding out from the soil of the flower bed where the seeds were planted. When she takes a closer look, she realises that it’s a child’s hand. She gingerly digs the soil and discovers a human head. This head that has grown from the sprout is Nozomi (Awano Sari), a young girl in a white dress. This mysterious girl wipes off the soil as she picks up a family photo in the living room. “Who are you?” Midori asks. Nozomi replies, “I’m your mother. You planted the seeds, didn’t you?” When Midori casually looks at the bag holding the seeds, she notices the words, “The flowers essential to you will bloom. Type of flower: human” written on it. She is astonished. Nozomi proceeds to say things that only her mother would know. She even stands in the kitchen and starts to make Midori’s favourite cabbage roll.

He mopes that he that not have talent unlike his classmate Yoshino (Kuroshima Yuina) who has demonstrated her flair for music. One day, Kuroki discovers an unfamiliar second-hand bookstore on a dimly lit street. He drops in and an old collection of music scores in German catches his attention. He is drawn by something on a music score with dark brown smudges which falls out from the set and tries to translate the German words written in the margin. It reads “A piano sonata for an upside down girl” “Never play it”. Kuroki is intrigued and starts search for information on the sonata. He lands on a website that warns of the loss of hands if this piece is not played correctly. His friend Noshita (Ouchida Yuhei) snorts with laughter but Kuroki is so curious about this music score that he decides to take a crack at it. When he starts playing, all the sounds around him suddenly disappear and he is only able to hear the notes of the piano. When he looks up, he realises that even the rain outside, the metronome and the second hand of the clock on the wall have stopped. This is the prologue to the tragedy surrounding a girl gifted in piano.\n",

This man is dressed like a wandering samurai and wears a white radish at his waist like a sword. Itsuki feels suspicious and tries to leave. But the man slashes with the white radish all of a sudden. Despite Itsuki’s attempt to dodge, the tip of the white radish brushes her arm and she bleeds. Itsuki panics and pleads for her life as if in supplication. The man says they will have a duel one month later, which makes no sense to her. After he finds the photo of Hagiyama in Itsuki’s student handbook, he threatens to slash Hagiyama if she flees and tells her to hone her skills well and leaves. While Itsuki is in a daze, she hears an old man ask if she would like to be his disciple. This old man also wears a white radish at his waist. He tells her, “If you take my instructions, you’ll definitely beat that man!” Itsuki is doubtful but begins to train in using vegetables as weapons under the old man...\n",
